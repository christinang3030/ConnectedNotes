# ConnectedNotes
Note-taking should enhance student learning instead of leading to more stress. ConnectedNotes is a web application that is designed to address cognitive overload by allowing collaboration and discussion among classmates. Through this application, students will be able to share the task of taking notes and address their confusion as a group.
